# Dubai Dash

## Introduction

Welcome to Dubai International Airport!

Dubai Dash is our system, which focuses on Dubai airport and all flights that pass through the airport or its airspace. Our goal is to provide a real-time analysis tool for flights that have the airport as their destination or departure point, allowing you to view their position and flight statistics, as well as those flights that have already landed, as these provide very useful information, such as the most popular countries of origin.

Our system provides a set of dashboards that will allow the user to collect all the necessary information in one place, instead of having to resort to several. Access to the information mentioned above will be carried out in a direct and simplified way, allowing the user to view, on the one hand, the data in real time, and on the other, to analyze statistical data, collected from the moment of system startup to the present. The main challenge of our system is to be able to collect data from the Opensky API and, through it, process and return information to our system, in a timely manner, allowing the user, for example, to view the position and information about flights.
